MLOPS LECTURE 20 : 1/MAY/2020


>>.in unsupervised learnig wehave to give inout only 
>>. i supervised learningwe have to give inout and output adn then train the model 
>>.neuron is just lkke a mathemaical funtiion
>>.when we have big data million of rows and coloumn then it is hard to do feautre selction or domain expert or use old ML method 
>>.ANN is approach which work like huma being mind
>>it do 2 things ||ar :1).backpropagation and 2).feature elemination 
>>.more layer means better learning 
>> before we do feature elemination we have to do feature engineering

>>. behind the scene when weintialize  a w.s git also create a hidden folder called .git
>>.  .git  folder is faloder which keep all the info of the file means a db for version
>>git only maintain matadata 
>>.if we wnt to do roll back we have to do copy in git db means we have  to do commmit than only git will do bACKUP
>>. git always give coy.commit name called commit id
>>. as we do we commit in local repo means our data is coorect and we cant creat a backu  of that data means creating versison
>>.if as we commit and we want to puch it to github we hve to do it manually to do it aotu  we have option in git called HOOKS 
>>. hooks is option in git to do thins auto so as we do commit it auto pust to github 
>>.for this we to go in c: .git/hooks
and there we have to create bash scrip with name post-commit 
c: notepad post-commit(no extn)
>> #!/bin/bash   to do this we have to write this to tll it is bash scrip command
    git push
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>.JENKINS>>>>>
>> if we want to auto run our job means we have to run our job at particular then we have option in jenkin e.i is trigger our job
>>. for we wantour job to auto dwnld our file from github then we have to trigger this job
>>. not to do this we option in jenkins > configure > build periodicly 
in this we can st our timer it will do our job at that tim e for ex: if want our job to run at every 1 min than we have to write it format only * * * * * 
this will runthe job after every 1 min
>>. but if our use case is to tun the job only when there is chng then we have concept pol scm 
it will only etch the meya data and if it see that there is some chng on 
then only it will dwnld the data 
othrwise it will not run tha job but behind the scene it will keep on running nd fetching the data
