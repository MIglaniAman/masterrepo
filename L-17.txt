>>.we can also create basic graph using Pandas funtion ex: .hist()  , .plot()
>>.for classificaation we should know what is our X and what is pur Y
>>.in classification when we have categorical variabe we have to convert it dummy variable
>>if thre are lot variable and all are pandas dataframe type then in pandas we have funtion "concat" which  add all columns in 1 list 
>> c: pandas.concat([ , , ],axis =1)
>>.for doing binary classificaio we have to do import logistic Regression from skleran
>>.for error we use MSE in LINera regrssion but in binary classification we cant do it 
>>. to find model accuracy in binary classsifaiction we need some logic for this we use a concept called "confusion Metrics" .it will help in model accuracy
>>. to use "cofusion metics" we have to import lib called "confusion_metrics 
>>.there are two types of error : type 1 error (false positive) , type 2 erroe(false negative)

devoplecture
>>.SCM (source code manager)
>>. SCM tool github
>>.folder created in github mens workspace == repository
>>.to create reposotory in gihub and intialize this repository
>>.git hub in not only for sharing but aslo for version 
>>.SCM also maintain history means keep all previous data in backup
>>. if our data is keep on chnging then we should maintain the history means we should maintai verison
>>.latest data also known as head means git is heading toward my latest data
>>.VCS manages version for data
>>. CVCS :centaralised control version control system
>>.in cvcs we have only 1 chalnge called Network
>>. this is the reason moving from Cvcs to Dvcs 

>>. point-in-time means creating version
>>.github is singlepoint of failure 
>>. to create local repo we have install git on our system
>>.when we have peer-peer connction /sharing then this is called Dvcs
>>. to dwnld complte repo from github we have to do clone
it will donlwd the repo=folder +files +all version
>>.git log [filename] it will tell us all the history about tht file
>>. to upload a fil from local repo to github we have proces for 
>>. first the folder should tracked by git is called git workspacea
>..git has great thing that is Vcs and git keep on trackng the file
>>.to add file in workspace c: git add [filename]
>>.to move to stash area c: git stash [filename]
>>.to add in commit area c: git commit [filename]-m "comment"   {-m is used for commnting as a sake for remebering
>>.if want to workspace is clean or not; c: git status 
>>. git always compare with commit area and orgin(github repo)
>>.how to roll back in git in local repo 2step are there
>>.git reset HEAD [commid-id] [filename]
>>. git chechkout --[filename]
