MLPOS LECTURE 19 : 30/04/2020

>>.to analyze data or feature selection also we ahve to do data analysis using visual e.i graph
>>. graph we ahve created using folium ,matplotlib/seaborn/pandas but all tha grpah are static they are not dynamic 
>>. to create dynamic/interactive graph we have famous python lib plottly and aslo cufflinks
>>.in a list when we appned or add new thing there is one complication that the position no./index chng if we appned of all the other list member
>>. in such type of list in which the position chng than it courrupt other member also 
>> instaed of list we can use another data type called directory 
>>. in directory we have ability toh give own index 
>>. to create directory we have too use '{}'
ex: dict = {'no':1, 'email':man@}
>>.index in directry is calle key and other data is called value
>>.we have another wya to create directory
ex  dictn = dict(id =1 , name = 'aman') usnid dict keyword we can create dictinonary
>>.we know we use numpy to create array
>>. weknow range() funtion create the range we want 
>>. if want create creat list usnig range we can also want to print  that then
list(range(1,100))
>>.in numpy if random funtion and in randim we randint keyword which will create a random array 
np.random.randint(1,100,10)
>>. if want to create array of diffrnt size and columns we have another keyword in random
np.random.randn(10,4) it will creat 10 rowsa nd 4 columns
>>.if we want to create numy array to dataframe we have funtion in pandas called datframe
pd.DataFrame(x)
>>.and if want ot give column name in dataframe we have keyword columns in datframe 
pd.DataFrame(x, columns = [" " , " " , " " ]) 
>>. to use plotly we have to 1st plotly lib 
import plotly.graph_objs as go 
>>. to use  offline mode we have another funtion
import plotly.offline as pyo
>>.to create we have scater keyword 
datgraph =go.Scatter(x,y); but this will not xreate a graph it will show sum array 
>>.and to create graph we ave another funtion 
fig= go.Figure([]); it will tke the value of datagraph variable 
>>. now if we wamt ot see the graph we have funtion plot in plotly 
pyo.plot(fig) ; it will show the line graph now we want scatter graphwe have "  mode = 'marker' " keyword in sctter funtion 
>>. if want  to set title we have another funtion called Layout" 
c: layout= go.Layout(tile='marks" ) 
now te see title we have put in layout keyword in Figure funtion
c:fig =go.Figure(data=DATAGRAPH,layout=layout)


>>. if want to use pyplot but using it is very comlicated due to lots o codes
intead of using it we have new lib called ciiflinks
whose syntax look like pandas or directly using pandas

>>.to use cufflinks we have to import cufflinks lib
>>.to use offlone we have funtion called c: cufflinks.go_offline()
>>.to use cufflink which is similiar to pandas just only use iplot instead of plot funtion
c:dataset.iplot(x =" " , y = " " , kind = " ", mode =" ")

>>. to make 3-D graph we just have to give the in pdandas dateframe in iplot
dataset = pd.Dataframe({id :x1,marks:y1,id:z1})
>>.to create graph just use this command : dataset.iplot(kind='surface')




<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<JENKINS LECTURE 19 : 30/04/2020 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
>>.jenkins is built over java  ut it is not necessary to learn java for jenkins
>>.to use jenkins we have to install open jdk java
>>. to start jenkins we have start it services 
c: systemct start jenkins
>>.jenkins works on port no. 8080
>>.to use jenkins webui 
c: http://ip:8080
>>.mian power of jenkins is plugins
>>.jenkins is a CI tool 
what task we want from jenkins to do, for this we have tocreate job
>>.the 1st page of jenkins webui is jenkons portal or dashboard
>>.if our job is flexible measn it is freestyle project
>>.item==project==job
>>.blue coor means succeful ,red means unsuccessful
>>.if our job is fail we should go to console ouput in confugiration option
>>.git jenkins dont know git language for this we  have to make jenkins intelligent so here the concept plugins come up
>>.means if we want to integrate jenkins with other tools thenwe have to install plugins
>>. to install plugins > manage jenkin> manage plugins
search nd dwnld accrdn to your need
>>. if want to integrate git with jenkins 
>>. we only want to tell jenkins what to do 
for ex: clone of repo from git 
>>. we have only give url to jenkins in source code mangemnt while creating a job

>>.program is rum by some user or account 
>>. here in jenkins run command by jenkins user 
>>.if we run any command which jenkins user dont have power at that time 
and we have to give the power to jenkin user
c: setfacl -m u:jenkins:rwx <folder orfil name>
>>.everthing that jeninsdwnld keep in their workspace .
