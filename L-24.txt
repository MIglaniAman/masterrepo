>>.every image pixel is feature 
>>. for feature elemination NN is great approach but 1 imp point is if we are doing feature elemination then after removing the feature our info. should be loose
>>.FEATURE EXRction main point is to secure information and method we used to do feature extractioni scomvolition
>>.we can learn from single pixel but it will not give us any information nor it will make any sense means we not get to know which is correlated or not
>>. combinig the feature that are correalated to each other .so that to make 1 feature is called feature extraction  
>>. main moto of feature extraction is to 1)minimize featur 2). not to losse info.
>>.huge box feature thatwill tell feature  are corelated or not are called filter==kernel==feature detector
>>.who will help in picking feature and combing those feature . ? .here filter decided in picking feature 
>>.convulation filter behind the scene help in convolution to come to know whether there is object or not
>>.box sixe ==kernel==feature detector decide how many feature we will have 
>>. normally size of box is 3x3 
>>.if we dont have any edge then it will think that the feature is not imp
>>.bigger the size of filter may loose info 
>>.smalleer the size of filter may take lot of tym to trian the model
>>.jumping if the boxes from pixle to other pixel is called "stride"
>>.Stride play main role in loosing feature and info and normally we stride is set at 1 means 1 pixel per jump
>>.convlutio is mechanism to find the feature and for finding the feature which will detect edge
>>.no. of filter is together called feature map











DEVOPS LECTURE 24/09  : 08/05/2020

>>.whenever we run JENTIN job it lofe depend upon time of it run
>>. whenver we a run a job the job is executed by jenkins and the exexcute these job called exexcutor
>>. bydefault er have 2 executor and we can chng these aslo in jekins setting
>>.if run more than 2 job then 3rd job will remian in build queue
>>.we know about wo type pipelines  pulgin : its  tool to visualize our job graphically .
1) build pipelines 2) deleviry pipeline
