>>.NN is just type of mathematical function behind THE SCENE
>>.NN great thing is they do auto feature selction
>>.what machine will tell is paramter like :in bias and weight
>>. what we have to chng/tell to machinelearning that is "Hyperparameter" like : no. of neuron , no. of layer and how much feature they need or no. of epocs 
>>. NN is a approach/architecture which know no. of feture but dont know which one is imo .So it work like human mind
>>.more no. hidden layers = more good in doing Selction of good feature and accurate weight and bias
>>. A.f fo milti classification output is Softmax adn many more like this
>>. in pndas if want to count per categorical variable then we hava funtion in it 
C:y.values_count 
>>. IF OUR PREDICTION IS CATEGORICAL THEN WE HAVE TO CONVERT IT INTO DUMMY_VARIABLE BUT  we should not drop any of the variable bcz it is our output as it not a feature which will do dublicacy
>>drop a column in data we have option in pndas 
>>.C:dataset.drop('class',axis=1)
>>.before programmingit is god to do fature selection
>>.DEnse funtion bydefault use kernel intializer = golot_intializer ;it will decide rndom wieght and bias
>>. if we have categorical virable then we have to tell in last neuron how much categorical variable we have means each nueron for ouput we need :her output ke liye ek neuron
>>.loss funtion for multi classification is categorical_crossentropy
>>.model.layer[0].input : it will give info about layer

>>.to run a program we need o.s 
>>. we 4 ways to depoly os  on  1). bare metal 2).virtual mahine 3).container 4).cloud computing
>>. to see docker ip c: docker inspect 
>>. every himage has its history . to see hitory c:docker hisotry [osname] it will tell us baout main content where it has its appache web folder linked
>>.if want to copy fram base os to dcoker  os 
c:docker cp [file] osnmae:path 
>>. if want to link/mount a folder from base os to docker os folder so we have to do it at the tim of launching it 
>>.docker run -dit -v /foldername:dockrfoldername --name [osame] [osimage]
liml/mount means if there is any chng in base folder it will chng in docker folder 
>>.whenever docekr os is launched .it is launched in isolated world means no one can connect to these os from outside world 
>>. not to expose these docker os we have networking concept pat means adress transfaring 
>>.docker run on a port no. 80
c: docker runn -dit -p 8083:80 -v /lwweb:/usr/local/appache2/httpds
>>.as we are doing automation 
so root user have all the power to do anything but jenkins user dont 
>>. if wna jenkns user to get all the power lke root we have to chng in linux sudeurs file
>>.in that we have to give power to jenkins
>>. in Jenkisn we know that jenkin has all power but JENKIN dont for this we have to use sudo 
>>.IN jenkins if want to triger a job after complete of that job
means we have to do job chaining then the in jjob2 we have to give trigger that after the first complte for this we have Build triiger option in config 
and give the job after which we want it trigger means kiske baad chalani hai
