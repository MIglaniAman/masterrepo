DATA VISUALISATION
>>.to visualise data we have to create graph
>>. to create map we have to use html and java script and leaflets
but in python we have lib called folium
>>.folium uses there htmland havascript behind he scene
>>. for creating Map in folium we have funtion MAP .and in MAp we have keyword laction with zoom level
>> .folium.Map(location=[ , ] , zoom_start = )
>>.in folium we have funtion called marker for making the exact position of
>>. to convert pandas datafram to arraywe values keyword and from array to covert a list is we hav funtion tolist
>>. C:: dataframe.value.tolist
>>.folium takes only list value in location
>>. there are lots tile keyword in MAP
>>. in MArker we have keyword Icon to which can chng the colur and stye of icon(marker)
After break
>>. pretrained model which we directly load for model and whose weight and biaswe already know
>>. NN is the best algo for big data
type NN :rcnn ,cnn,ann
>>.to do objet.Detction we have aproach CNN
>>. types of CNN: r-cnn,fast-cnn, yolo ,mask-cnn
>>in these CNN we have use precrated weigth
>>>yolo is just name of the model
>>. yolo has 3 version
>>.yolo usses coco dataset 
>>.yolo-3 has more accuracy and more fast
>>.yolo is build over darknet (atye of framework)
>>.the funtion bheind the scene is darknet
>>.darknet uses NN approack at its back 
>>. 		OPtimizer 
>>. the 1st value of  which help wieght is called intializer
>..to wya to use intializer : manually ,algo method like xavier
>>.what intializer we shoul take means kitna bada ya kitna chota
>>.by default keras usses Xavier uniform intializer
>>.the duty of optimizer is to how much we have to jump to nextvalue to have  less error
>>. 2 types of optimizer : static(manually) ,adaptive(autochng and tuning itsel)
>>.jumo == step ==learnig rate
>>.we have to tell the optimizer the L.R
>>.if L.r is less we have great accuracy
>>.if L.R is high ess acuuracy and we will struck in an osccilation
>>.
